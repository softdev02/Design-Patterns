**🧩 Abstract Factory Pattern**

**Definition:**

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

This pattern is particularly useful when a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

**🔍 How It Works**

- **Abstract Product (Chair)**: Defines the interface for various chair types.

- **Concrete Products (VictorianChair, ModernChair)**: Implement the chair-specific behaviors.

- **Abstract Factory (ChairFactory)**: Provides an interface for creating a product family.

- **Concrete Factories**: Produce concrete chairs based on the required style.

- **Client Code**: Creates chairs without knowing their specific types, following the factory abstraction.

**🌟 Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern**

- **Encapsulation**: Centralizes the creation of product families.

- **Flexibility**: Easily swap out product families without modifying client code.

- **Consistency**: Ensures compatibility between products within the same family.
