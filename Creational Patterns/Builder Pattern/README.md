**🧩 Builder Pattern**

**Definition:**

The Builder Design Pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

This pattern is particularly useful when constructing objects that require multiple steps or configurations.

**🔍 How It Works**

**House (Product Class)**: Represents the complex object being built.

**HouseBuilder (Builder Class)**: Provides methods to set different parts of the house.

**build() Method**: Returns the final House object.

**BuilderPatternExample (Client)**: Demonstrates the creation of a House using the builder.

**🌟 Benefits of Builder Pattern**

**Step-by-Step Construction**: Handles complex construction processes efficiently.

**Code Reusability**: Reuse the same construction logic for multiple representations.

**Improved Readability**: Simplifies object creation with a clear and structured process.
Customization: Easily add or modify steps without changing client code.
