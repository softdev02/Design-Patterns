Software Design Patterns

What are Software Design Patterns?
Software Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured approach to solving recurring challenges in software development by offering proven templates or best practices. Patterns help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and efficient software systems.

Types of Software Design Patterns
There are three primary categories of design patterns:
Creational Patterns
Deal with object creation mechanisms to optimize resource usage and object management.
Examples:
1.Singleton
2.Factory Method
3.Abstract Factory
4.Builder
5.Prototype

Structural Patterns
Concerned with object composition and inheritance to create flexible and efficient structures.
Examples:
1.Adapter
2.Bridge
3.Composite
4.Decorator
5.Facade
6.Flyweight
7.Proxy


Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication and interaction between objects to ensure better responsibilities distribution.
Examples:
1.Chain of Responsibility
2.Command
3.Interpreter
4.Iterator
5.Mediator
6.Memento
7.Observer
8.State
9.Strategy
10.Template Method
11.Visitor


Total Number of Design Patterns
The GoF (Gang of Four) book identifies 23 classic design patterns. Beyond these, there are additional patterns used in enterprise applications and specific paradigms such as:
Concurrency Patterns: Thread Pool, Semaphore, Monitor Object, etc.
Architectural Patterns: MVC (Model-View-Controller), Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, and Layered Architecture.
