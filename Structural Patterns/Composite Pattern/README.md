**🧩 Composite Pattern**

**Definition:**

Composite is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly..

   




**🔍 How It Works**

**Component**: Declares the common interface for both simple and complex objects in the composition.

**Leaf**: Represents simple objects with no child components. Implements the Component interface.

**Composite**: Contains child components and implements the operations defined by the Component interface.

**Client**: Interacts with objects in the composite structure through the Component interface.


**🌟 Benefits of Composite Pattern**

**Uniformity**: Treats individual and composite objects uniformly.

**Simplified Client Code**: Reduces complexity in client code by allowing them to interact with abstract components.

**Easier Object Hierarchy Management**: Adding and removing child components is straightforward.

**Scalability**: Supports complex hierarchical structures without changing the client code.
